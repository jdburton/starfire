Project Number 6

Project due date: July 25th

Project description: 

This is Phase 1 of the project to port the game Starfire from Visual C++ 6.0 and DirectDraw to Pygame.

The original milestone goals were:

	1. To create and render animated sprites on screen. 

	2. The user will be able to control and move their own ship. 

	3. A fixed number of enemy ships will be created and moved on the screen by the AI.
	
All three of these goals have been accomplished: Sprites are being created and rendered to the screen,
the user can move the ship with the mouse or keyboard, and four enemy ships are displayed on the screen
and moving with a (primitive) AI. 

Additionally, the following goals have been met:
	
	4. The game includes a scrolling background.
	5. The game includes theme music.
	6. The game can play sounds
	
The easiest part of this project:

	1. Using Pygame. Pygame provides much of the functionality automatically that was hard and manual in Visual C++.
	2. The sound and music API was especially easy to use.

Problems that I had in completing this project:

	1. Figuring out how to design a game in the Model-View-Controller design pattern. It's hard to get used to, but once I did, I was able to dramatically reduce the 
	   amount of code in the project.
	   
	2. Figuring out how to move the sprites around without them either jittering or flying off the screen.
	
	3. Installing Python 3.6.6 with on a Mac with Pydev because Pygame doesn't work with Python 3.7 and downgrading breaks Homebrew dependencies.
