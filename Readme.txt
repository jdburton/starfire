Storyline:

The year is 2101.  Earth has enjoyed many years of peace.  It
is also a time of prosperity and discovery.  Colonies are being formed
and men are taking command of the stars.  But all is not quite well.

One day an urgent message is recieved from the New Europa Colony.  Although the transmission
is broken and quickly cut off, radar confirms that we are no longer alone in the universe.
What appears to be a significant fleet of unknown spaceships has descended upon the colony like
a swarm of locusts.  And like locusts, they destroy everything in their path.

After making quick work of the defenses of the Mars Colony, the fleet heads straight for Earth.  Even Earth's space defenses are no match for this grand space armada.  However, there is one last hope.  Scientists at Clemson University have come up with a new starfighter prototype, the Starfire X1.  Faster and stronger than any previous Earth fighter, the Starfire X1 offers the Earth a new hope to defeat this new enemy.  

As you are the best pilot left on Earth, you have been chosen to fly the Starfire into battle.  However, it will not be easy. As one ship, you are being asked to destroy a battle hardened space fleet.  The fate of the world is resting on your shoulders.

//============================================================================

Controls:

Equipped with Dual Ion Thrusters and Three Fire-Linked High-Energy Plasma Cannons, the Starfire is a formidable weapon.  However, any starfighter is
only as good as the pilot who flies it.


Arrow Keys:  Move the Starfire around the screen.  Note: You can move forward faster than backward.

Space Bar:   Fire the Plasma Cannons

//============================================================================

Power Ups:

Occasionally the Earth Defense Force will send you reinforcements in small cargo containers during the battle:

Shield Containers:

	Blue and Marked with an 'S', these containers recharge your shield to full power.

Plasma Containers:

	Unfortunately, The Starfire can only generate enough power to keep one Plasma Cannon operational.  
	This will activate another Plasma Cannon.  These containers are red and marked with a 'P'.

Bonus Containers:

	Saving the world is nice, but you shouldn't have to do it for free.  This provides Bonus Points.
	(Extra Starfires are awarded at 20,000 & 50,000 pts).  These containers are yellow and marked with a 'B'.

X Containers:

	This containers contain what is called "Weapon X", an experimental weapon that can destroy all small enemy 
	fighters within a certain area.  These are green and marked with an 'X'

Enemies:

	Dart Fighters:

		Small, lightly shielded, lightly armed unmanned spacecraft.  These ships are 
		very fast, and will try to ram you at full speed.

	Drone Fighters:

		Highly maneuverable, although lightly armed and shielded, these versitile fighters make up the 
		majority of the alien fleet.

	Gunships:

		Although these ships are slow, they are heavily shielded and armed with Two High Power Blaster cannons. 

	Command Ship:

		Large, heavily shielded and well armed, these ships are surprisingly maneuverable.

Good Luck! And remember, Earth is counting on you.
